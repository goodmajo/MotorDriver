# MotorDriver2

## Summary
This is a small library for Arduino users to help them control DC motors in a cleaner fashion. The first incarnation of this library came about in late 2016 while I was still in college. I wrote it to control a robot for a class assignment, and it was the first big thing I ever wrote in a language that wasn't MATLAB. It worked really well, but I had no idea what I was doing and as a result it was extremely messy. This new version is a lot better and easier to understand, and it's basically just a wrapper around a bunch of Arduino functions so newbies can easily understand how it works if they have a rudimentary knowledge of how Arduino works. I hope that this also represents OOP in a way that young programmers can wrap their heads around.

I hope people find this useful!
